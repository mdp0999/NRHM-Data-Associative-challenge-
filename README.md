# NRHM-Data-Associative-challenge-
What analyses should be undertaken by SocialCops to help the Government of Maharashtra's Health Department to identify the root causes of  the extreme Health trends in Nagpur District?

**Background**
You have been contacted by the Government of Maharashtra's Health Department to build the Analytics engine using the data recorded under the flagship program: National Rural Health Mission (NRHM). The dashboard is targeted for the respective state decision making bodies (Chief Minister's Office). A sample of the data for NRHM Maharashtra, Public Healthcare Centre (PHC), has been shared (Excel). Data Download Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7_chiwcn-qBSVVKcDhsaXNZeEU

Chief Minister's Office is very keen to understand the possible reasons associated to these health trends, in order to realign scheme implementation efforts to quality of services vs. extent of coverage.

**Task**
As a Data Associate in the team, you are requested to do the following: 

1. Clean, structure, and prepare the data for the analysis so that you can compare all the files together. 
2. In the decentralized healthcare scenario, Sub centre makes the lowest division, followed by PHC and then block level hospitals (or RH). Tell us if the numbers follow this vertical hierarchy.
3. Report 10 important health trends and visualize them using different trend graphs. Brownie points for Causal analysis!

**Submissions:  **

1. Final cleaned file(s). 
2. Indicators that you are using as an Excel Sheet.
3. Word doc around the trends, and final results that you want to share with the Government of Maharashtra. Use basic visualisation to show the trends and your final results.
4. Script(s). 


**Notes:**

* An internal document on scheme can be found here: NRHM (https://quip.com/HWnFArWxQmaY#RBYACAGtAQN) NRHM (https://quip.com/HWnFArWxQmaY)

* The following links will give you an idea about the current reports generated for monitoring purposes by the Ministry: (1) https://nrhm-mis.nic.in/hmisreports/frmstandard_reports.aspx ; (2) https://nrhm-mis.nic.in/hmisreports/analyticalreports.aspx (3) ; https://nrhm-mis.nic.in/Pages/HMIS-PeriodicReport.aspx
* Ensure that you understand what are important health indicators globally - read up on UN and World Bank reports. 
* The task focus is to answer questions such as: What are possible causes of an increasing Maternal Mortality Rate in Maharashtra? Is there an impact of Anemia on Maternal Mortality? Does increasing Immunization coverage during AnteNatal Care (ANC) help  in reducing # maternal deaths during/post pregnancy?
* Cover recent news articles to find recent metrics that were quoted and their trends - this will give you an idea on what is crucial to assess the scheme's progress.
* The Ministry officials are very well versed with NRHM implementation. Your suggestions should be fine tuned to technicalities of scheme implementation.
